# Project-1---Game : 

Title:
- Sonic, The Speed of Sound at 767MPH


Design Choices/Languages:
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
- JS (JavaScript)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- JQuery 
- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- GIFS (Graphics Interchange Format)


WireFrame:
- 2D Video Game 


Scheduled Completion:
- I would want to have completed all of my work two days before deployment. During the two days, I will touch up any design flaws.


How the Game Works:
- Sonic will be running at the beginning of the game; you must, as the player, move him left and right to collect rings to add time to play and avoid traps.
- You will continue to garner points, until you eventually hit an obstacle or time runs out.
